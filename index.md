## Women Mobility in Saudi Arabia

King Salman has issued a historic royal decree granting driving licenses for women in the kingdom as of next June. This decree will affect all Saudi (9,850,218) and Non-Saudi (3,677,643) women living in the kingdom.

The majority of Saudis (63%) were pleased with the decree. They believe that lifting the ban on women driving has a positive impact on modernizing Saudi Arabia and increased independence for them.

Driven heavily by the “Saudi Vision 2030,” Saudi Arabia is looking at a variety of changes that will make the country globally competitive and less oil-reliant in the future.

2030 VISION GOALS    
-To increase women’s participation in the workforce from 22% to 30%  
-To lower the rate of unemployment from 11.6% to 7%

Given that only 2 million out of the total women Saudi Arabia are part of the workforce, hopefully with them behind wheels, their career prospects and participation in the workforce will improve. 
Knowing that lack of mobility is a major obstacle; having to rely on male relatives or private hires. 

87% of Saudi families have private drivers
1.3 million foreigners were hired as drivers.
25 billion Saudi Riyals as remittances.

Even with regard to public transport and other transport services, 92% of intending drivers are expected to reduce their reliance on taxis and services such as Uber as a result, keeping in mind that 80% of Uber rides are for women. Accordingly, the rate of unemployment will reduce.

While going to work was the key reason to drive (45%) dropping children (39%) was the other expressed reason. 
Interestingly, about 17% of the intending drivers expected to shop more and indulge in more leisure activities. 
Hence, with the increase in female disposable income, a positive effect on the retail, entertainment, and food & beverage sector is anticipated in the near future.
